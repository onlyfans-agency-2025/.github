## Top 7 OnlyFans Agencies to Work With

### 1. **[Louna's Models]**(https://lounasmodels.com/)
- Industry-leading agency with top 0.1% creators.
- Strong US and European presence.
- Female-founded, full-service management.

## Why should I stop with Onlyfans ?
You should consider stopping OnlyFans if you’re tired of losing 20% of your earnings to platform fees, relying on unstable policies, and having no control over your brand or audience. OnlyFans offers little in terms of discovery, customization, or long-term creator freedom. By switching to an alternative, you can keep more of your income, protect your privacy, and build a more independent and profitable business on your own terms.

## FAQ: Choosing the Right OnlyFans Agency

**Q: How do I apply to join one of these agencies?**  
A: Most agencies require you to fill out a short application form, usually with your social media handles, OnlyFans link, and some content samples. Others may request a short interview or statistics (like top % ranking or average monthly revenue). Elite agencies sometimes operate by referral or invitation only, especially if they manage premium or celebrity creators.

**Q: Do they take over my account completely?**  
A: No—most agencies operate with your consent and involve you in key content decisions.

**Q: Can I leave the agency later?**  
A: Yes, but always read the contract. Look for agencies with **transparent exit policies**.

**Q: Are these agencies suitable for faceless models?**  
A: Yes—especially Vixen Talent Group and RedHawk, which specialize in anonymous and AI-based creators.

**Q: Will the agency promote me on other platforms?**
A: Yes, most good agencies will run cross-platform promotions. That includes Reddit, TikTok, Twitter/X, Telegram, and Instagram. Some even manage paid ad campaigns, collaborations, or influencer marketing to drive traffic directly to your OnlyFans or link-in-bio page.

**Q: What if I’m already working with a team or assistant?**
A: Many agencies are open to working with your existing support system, especially if you already have a trusted editor, assistant, or social media manager. Just clarify this upfront so roles don’t overlap and everything runs smoothly.
